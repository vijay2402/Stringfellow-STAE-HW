# Stringfellow-STAE-HW
 Jacob Stringfellow  STAE Homework Write-up  Due to the minimal information on what the Parking Calculator specifications were, much of my testing approach came from putting in values I believed to be invalid and making sure that the result reflected that. I also based tests on common-sense and thought about usability and user-experience. Later research showed that my main testing strategies were the black-box testing, boundary testing, and fuzz testing approaches.  Most of the invalid testing came with submitting empty fields and putting dates &amp; times that are non-existent, while the user-experience tests came from what I thought would be the most easy to understand the results that were being given.  I used the Selenium framework along with the C# programming language to write my automated tests. I used two Selenium NuGet packages to assist with my testing efforts, Selenium WebDriver and Selenium WebDriver Support Classes, along with a reference to Visual Studio Test Tools Unit Testing.
